# Agents as Tools

The simplest multi-agent pattern: one orchestrator agent calls specialist agents as tools. The orchestrator stays in control, decides when to delegate, and synthesizes the results. This is the hub-and-spoke model.

There are two approaches - pass an agent directly in the tools list (simplest), or wrap it in a `@tool` function for full control over invocation.

## Files

- **agent_as_tool.py** - Demonstrates both approaches:
  1. **Direct pass** (commented out) - A researcher agent is passed directly in the writer's tools list. The writer delegates research tasks automatically.
  2. **@tool decorator** (active) - Wraps an agent in a `@tool` function, giving you control over the prompt, model selection, and how results are returned. Uses a stronger model (Opus) for orchestration and a lighter model (Sonnet) for the specialist.

## Running

```bash
python agent_as_tool.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **The docstring is the routing logic**: It tells the orchestrator when to delegate. The model routes based on tool descriptions - you never write an `if` statement.
- **Agent isolation**: Each sub-agent has its own context window, model, and tools. They're fully independent - one agent's context doesn't leak into another's.
- **Orchestrator control**: The orchestrator decides when to call the specialist, what to ask, and how to use the response. It's a function call, not a handoff.
- **Model heterogeneity**: Use a stronger model for the orchestrator (which needs to reason about what to delegate) and a cheaper model for specialists (which do focused work).
- **Silent sub-agents**: Use `callback_handler=None` on sub-agents to suppress their streaming output. Only the orchestrator streams to the user.
- **When to use this pattern**: Clearly separable domains, when you want one agent synthesizing everything, when you need request/response semantics between agents.
