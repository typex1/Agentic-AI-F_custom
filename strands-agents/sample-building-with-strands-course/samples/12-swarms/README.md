# Swarms

Swarms let agents hand off to each other autonomously - there's no predefined execution order. Each agent decides who to pass control to next based on what it discovers. When one agent hands off to another, it's a full transfer of control, not a function call that waits for a return.

Swarms operate over a shared context, so each agent sees the accumulated work from previous agents - prior findings, handoff history, and state contributed during execution.

## Files

- **debugging_swarm.py** - An incident triage system with four agents: triage, log analyst, metrics analyst, and deployment reviewer. Agents share context and build on each other's discoveries.
- **mixed_patterns.py** - Demonstrates composing patterns together: a Swarm used as a node inside a Graph, and an Agent used as a tool inside another Graph node. Shows that these patterns aren't mutually exclusive.

## Running

```bash
python debugging_swarm.py
python mixed_patterns.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **Autonomous handoff**: Agents decide who gets control next based on what they discover. The execution path emerges organically.
- **Shared context**: Each agent sees everything prior agents contributed - findings, analysis, handoff reasons. Context accumulates across the swarm.
- **Full transfer**: Unlike agents-as-tools (request/response), a handoff means the current agent's turn is done. The next agent takes over completely.
- **Safety bounds**: Swarms need limits to prevent runaway execution:
  - `max_handoffs` - limits how many times agents can pass control
  - `max_iterations` - caps total agent turns
  - `execution_timeout` - hard time limit
- **Pattern mixing**: Swarms, graphs, and agents-as-tools can compose. A swarm can be a node in a graph. An agent-as-tool can be called from within a graph node.

## When to Use Swarms

- The optimal execution sequence isn't known in advance
- Agents need to build on each other's discoveries
- Collaborative investigation where findings drive the next step
- Complex triage where different specialists are needed based on what's found
