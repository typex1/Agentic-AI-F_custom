# Conversation Management

As conversations grow, they can overflow the model's context window. Conversation managers control what happens when messages accumulate - you can drop old messages, summarize them, or use a cheaper model for the summarization to save costs.

Proactive compression triggers summarization before you hit the limit, so the agent never fails due to context overflow.

## Files

- **context_manager_auto.py** - The recommended default. One parameter (`context_manager="auto"`) gives you offloading, summarization, and proactive compression with no configuration. In benchmarks, this cut costs by 55% while improving accuracy.
- **context_manager_agentic.py** - For agents that need to decide what context to keep. The model gets tools to summarize, truncate, or pin messages. Use this when your agent needs to protect specific context across long conversations.
- **sliding_window.py** - Keeps the N most recent messages and drops the oldest. Simplest approach - fast but loses context.
- **summarizing.py** - Summarizes old messages instead of dropping them. Preserves key information while reducing token count. Includes proactive compression.
- **custom_summarizer.py** - Uses a cheaper model (Haiku) for the summarization step to reduce costs. Also includes proactive compression and `ContextOffloader`.
- **customer_service_tools.py** - Mock tools shared across examples.
- **steering_handlers.py** - Steering handlers shared across examples.
- **skills/** - Skill definitions for the customer service agent.

## Running

```bash
# Recommended: auto mode (one-liner, best defaults)
python context_manager_auto.py

# Agentic mode (model decides what to keep)
python context_manager_agentic.py

# Manual strategies (for understanding what auto does under the hood)
python sliding_window.py
python summarizing.py
python custom_summarizer.py
```

Have a long conversation and watch how each strategy handles the growing history differently.

## Key Concepts

- **`context_manager="auto"`**: The recommended default. Offloads large tool results, compresses old messages into summaries, and fires proactive compression at 85% usage. One line, no configuration.
- **`context_manager="agentic"`**: The model gets context management tools and decides what to retain, summarize, or drop. Use when the agent needs judgment about what's important to keep across long conversations.
- **Context window limits**: Every model has a maximum context size. Without management, long conversations will fail.
- **Sliding window**: Drop the oldest N messages. Fast and simple, but you lose information permanently. Best when old context doesn't matter.
- **Summarization**: Compress old messages into a summary. Preserves key facts while reducing token count. Better when earlier context still matters.
- **Proactive compression**: Trigger summarization at a configurable threshold rather than waiting for overflow.
- **Cost optimization**: Use a cheaper model for summarization - the summary doesn't need your most capable model.
- **Context offloading**: The `ContextOffloader` plugin externalizes large tool results to storage, keeping only a preview in context.
